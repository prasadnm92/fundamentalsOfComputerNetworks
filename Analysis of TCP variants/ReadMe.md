# PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF TCP VARIANTS

The original design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) worked reliably, but was unable to provide acceptable performance in large and congested networks. Several TCP variants have been proposed since then (TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, Vegas, BIC, CUBIC, SACK, and others) with mechanisms to control and avoid congestion. The objective of this project was to analyze the performance of these different TCP variants. I used the NS-2 network simulator to perform experiments that will help understand the behavior of the TCP variants under various load conditions and queuing algorithms.

The final product of this assignment is a report that describes the results of the simulated experiments.
